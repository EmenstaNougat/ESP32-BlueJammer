## ESP32-BlueJammer
The ESP32-BlueJammer disrupts various devices using an ESP32 and nRF24 modules, causing plenty of noise and sending unnecessary packets (DoS).              
                                                                    
It interrupts:                                                       
audio in speakers, smartphone connections, WiFi, RC Drones (etc.), IoT devices, and much more communicating on 2.4GHz!

Ideal for controlled disruption and security testing. Based on 2,4GHz communication.

It has a big range (over 30Meters+ - may vary on your antenna and hardware setup!) on newest Bluetooth versions with casual 2.4GHz antennas, you can easily increase this aswell by taking some simple "bigger" router antennas.
An amplifier (2.4GHz) may be an good option too!

Remember that jamming is illegal and should not be used with malicious intent!

## Hardware

### Required:

- **ESP32 Dev Module** (such as ESP32-WROOM-32U, any ESP32 should work as long as it has the needed pins!)
- **nRF24L01+PA+LNA** (2x)
- **10uF Capacitor** (2x) (any voltage above 5V)

### Additional:

- **3rd Antenna:** IPEX to SMA-F pigtail

### If you're looking to add a battery:

- **3.7V Li-Ion Battery**
- **JST PH 2.0 Connector**
- **TP4056 Charging Module**
- **3mm LED** (blue)
- **4.7k Ohm Resistor**
- **Mini Slide Switch**

### To screw the 3D printed case together you must have:

- **M3x16 Screws** (2x)
- **M3 Nuts** (2x)



## Antennas
A frequently asked question is whether the antennas are needed and what the third antenna is for, here is the answer:
Yes, you need at least both antennas for the nRF24's! Why? To have it working on a decent range!
The average range with standard known chinese 2.4GHz antennas is about 20meters. Upgrading those antennas will help a lot with getting more range!

2 antennas are for the HSPI and VSPI nRF24 modules!

The 3rd antenna is plugged to the ESP32 chip itself, wither via IPEX or soldered onto it's own antenna, if your ESP32 does not provide any option to add that one, it obviously won't be possible!
What is the 3rd antenna used for? The third antenna connected to the ESP32 chip itself helps with reliable long-range interference. It ensures a better intermediate signal and stability when jamming!
(The third antenna is your own decision and therefore optional!)



## Flashing ESP32 via webflasher
![ESP32-BlueJammerFlasher](https://dwdwpld.pages.dev/ESP32BlueJammerFlasher.png)                                                                 
I've created a webflasher to make it super easy for you to flash your ESP32 chip with the ESP32-BlueJammer firmware of your choice!
- Visit [ESP32-BlueJammerFlasher](https://esp32-bluejammerflasher.pages.dev)
- Connect your ESP32 via a data USB cable
- Choose your firmware, chip and connect
- Flash the firmware of your choice :D

If your ESP32 is not showing up in the device list or won't get recognized you will need to have [THESE DRIVERS INSTALLED](https://discord.com/channels/1229027335534153791/1260705681254645891/1268921897052012574) which can be found on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yNGhKxzqUE)!

## About the ESP32-BlueJammer and my source code
- **Is my ESP32-BlueJammer really working?**  
  Yes! My ESP32 BlueJammer is fully functional, and no one pauses the sound in the demo video. Many people have built their own ESP32-BlueJammer and confirmed that it works! Join my Discord and see for yourself! ;D

- **Why my ESP32-BlueJammer code is NOT open source**  
  There are several "BLE Jammers" available on GitHub, but they all have limitations in frequency range, channel coverage, and effective distance (around 5 meters). Therefore I decided to develop and code my own firmware for the ESP32-BlueJammer, aiming for superior performance.

  Despite some claims that I might have copied someone else's work, it's important to clarify that extracting source code from a compiled file (.hex, .bin, etc.) is practically impossible. If I had used someone else's work, I wouldn't have been able to create custom console banners, develop multiple firmware versions, or build a web flasher. My code is entirely written from scratch. There is nothing taken from other available codes, sources, codebases or resources as a foundation, if any even exist. My code remains closed source for now, to protect the significant effort and innovation I've invested in this project.

  This isn't my last project. I'm looking forward to implementing the ESP32-BlueJammer in further ongoing projects, so for now, I'd like the code to remain closed source. Maybe someday I'll make it open source!  
  -no one knows. ;D
